Tourist Recommendation System üåç
Overview
This project is a Tourist Recommendation System web app built using Streamlit, Folium, and Pandas. It helps users explore tourist destinations by specifying a location or receiving a random country suggestion. The app also provides the ability to request travel recommendations and view results via an interactive map interface.

Features
User Interaction: Choose a country from a dropdown or get a random suggestion.
Map Visualization: Display an interactive map centered on the selected location with a marker.
Travel Recommendations: Accepts user queries for travel-related suggestions and provides a link to view results directly on Google Maps.
Dynamic UI: Uses Streamlit for an intuitive and responsive user interface.
Country Selection: Utilizes a CSV file with country data for location selection.
How It Works
Specify Location: The user can choose a country from a dropdown list populated with unique country names from the dataset.
Random Country Suggestion: The app can also suggest a random country for users who are undecided.
Map Generation: A Folium map is created and displayed, centered on the selected country's coordinates.
Recommendations: Users can input a travel query, such as "Find hotels and activities in this area," and receive a Google Maps link to explore further.
Technologies Used
Streamlit: For building the web application.
Folium: For creating and displaying interactive maps.
Pandas: For data handling and processing.
Python Standard Libraries: random, urllib.parse.
